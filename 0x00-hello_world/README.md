This project represents my initial foray into the realm of C programming, as an integral part of my studies in ALX Software Engineering curriculum. The project consists of several files that showcase the fundamental aspects of C compilation and programming.

The files included in this project are:

File 0-preprocessor: This script runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the resulting output to another file.

File 1-compiler: This script compiles a C file without linking it.

File 2-assembler: This script generates the assembly code for a C program and stores it in an output file.

File 3-name: This script compiles a C file and creates an executable named 'cisfun'.

File 4-puts.c: This C program prints the exact string "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle", followed by a newline.

File 5-printf.c: This C program prints a string that is grammatically correct and artistically impressive, followed by a newline.

File 6-size.c: This C program prints the size of various data types on the computer where it is compiled and executed.

File 100-intel: This script generates the assembly code (using Intel syntax) for a given C program and saves the output to a file.

File 101-quote.c: This C program prints the exact string "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a newline, to the standard error.

Overall, this project serves as an introduction to the basics of C programming, compilation, and assembly, and provides a foundation for further exploration in this field.
